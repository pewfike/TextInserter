# TextInserter v1.0
Is a small project which helps me during my Customer Support job so I can semi-automize the ticketing system using keyboard inputs. 

# TextFileInserter v1.1
- Creating templates using file reading.
- More and more texts.

# TextFileInserter v1.1.1
- This mini update is focused on more chat templates , not tickets/notification with the usage of multiple macros.

# TextFileInserter v1.1.2
- Updated the file paths so the app can be used by every one.

# Coming soon... v2.0
- UI that can be used with various buttons and templates.
