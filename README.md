# TextInserter v1.0
Is a small project which helps me during my Customer Support job so I can semi-automize the ticketing system using keyboard inputs. 

# TextFileInserter v1.1
- Creating templates using file reading.
- More and more texts.

# TextFileInserter v1.1.1
- This mini update is focused on more chat templates , not tickets/notification with the usage of multiple macros.
- Added visual representation in the App with each macro, a quality of life improvement:

# Coming soon... v2.0
