How to install “TextFileInserter” app:
1. Download and Install Python 3.12 from the Microsoft store: Python 3.12 - Official app in the Microsoft Store 

After Python it’s finally installed, run the following commands in the “Command Prompt” which can be open from the Windows Search, just by typing “cmd”:

`pip install keyboard
`

`pip install pyperclip

The button from the middle it’s a drop down list with all the text files that are in the folder which contains each type of template that I found necessary/relevant for our daily use. Select it, the box that’s above the button will be filled with the desired text, therefore press “Copy to Clipboard” button and Voila, that’s it.

As a side note, if the text file it’s a notification template, there’s another small box called “Notification Title” which will contain just the title in order to be accurate with the copy → pasting.
